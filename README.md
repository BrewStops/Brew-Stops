# ☕ Brewstops

**Brewstops** is a community-driven café finder designed for cyclists and outdoor adventurers.  
It helps riders discover and review the best bike-friendly cafés, water refill points, and pit-stops along their routes — because every great ride deserves a great coffee stop.

## 🚴‍♂️ What is Brewstops?

Cyclists know that the best part of any ride is the café stop.  
Brewstops was built to make finding those perfect coffee spots easy — whether you’re on a long weekend ride, exploring a new route, or just looking for somewhere local that welcomes bikes.

With Brewstops, riders can:
- 📍 **Find** cafés and rest stops near their location or along their planned route  
- ⭐ **Rate and review** spots for quality, atmosphere, and cyclist-friendliness  
- 🧭 **Filter** by amenities like bike racks, refill stations, outdoor seating, or dietary options  
- 🗺️ **Add new cafés** to the map so other riders can discover them too  
- 🗣️ **Share** their favourite mid-ride coffee stops with the community  

The aim is simple — to create a living, growing database of the best cyclist-friendly cafés, powered by riders themselves.

## 💡 Why Brewstops?

Unlike general map apps, Brewstops focuses entirely on **the cycling experience**.  
It’s not about finding just any café — it’s about finding the right stop: one that understands muddy cleats, water bottles, and the post-ride caffeine craving.

Brewstops builds community by helping cyclists support local businesses, connect with other riders, and make every route a little bit tastier.
